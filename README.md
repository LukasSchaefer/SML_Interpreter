# SML Interpreter
This interpreter of the functional programming language Standard ML (SML) is written in SML itself.
It was created by me during the Programming 1 lecture at Saarland University, lectured by Prof. Dr. Gert Smolka,
and is based on the content of chapter 12 of the underlying German book "Eine Einf√ºhrung in die Informatik mit Standard ML" of
Gert Smolka himself.
